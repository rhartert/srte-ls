# SRTE-LS ‚ö°Ô∏è

SRTE-LS is a fast optimizer to find (near) optimal traffic placement in Segment Routing enabled networks. It is a Go implementation of the Link-Guided Local Search algorithm presented in [[1](https://research.google/pubs/expect-the-unexpected-sub-second-optimization-for-segment-routing/), [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=1jocmcIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=1jocmcIAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC)].
