**Looking for collaborators:** I'm interested in working with people to 
integrate this optimizer (or [an extended version](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=1jocmcIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=1jocmcIAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MCs)) into a real-world network 
controller. If you're interested, please contact me at ren.hartert@gmail.com.

# SRTE-LS

SRTE-LS is a Local Search (LS) solver to solve the Segment Traffic Engineering 
(SRTE) problem. It is a Go implementation of the approach described in  
[this paper](https://research.google/pubs/expect-the-unexpected-sub-second-optimization-for-segment-routing/) 
and [this thesis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=1jocmcIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=1jocmcIAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC).
